# hello-world
my very first project as a grown man.
Mi name is Angel, better known as "el Bueno".
Landed in this world more than 40 years ago. But it hasn't been until lately that I'm getting to understand way better this modern times living.
Haven't you notice that the difference between aliens and human beings seems to be simillar to differences of an iPhone in comparison with an android device, respectively?
In both cases first ones seem to be way too much for the second ones to even approximate to them. But it's ok, we got expandable capacities!
